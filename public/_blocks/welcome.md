Welcome

[D3](http://d3js.org/) is a widely-used and powerful library for creating
[visualizations on the web](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery).
It was created by [Mike Bostock](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/)
as a [research project](http://vis.stanford.edu/papers/d3) at Stanford University,
and now has an active [open source community](https://github.com/mbostock/d3).

We have written these tutorials to give people with little or no programming
or web-development experience an idea of what making visualizations
with D3 is like. For more background on web technologies, we recommend checking
out the free online courses on [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/).
