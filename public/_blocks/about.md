About
-----

This D3 workshop was created by [Michael Brooks](http://students.washington.edu/mjbrooks)
and John Robinson for the [HCDE 511 Information Visualization](http://courses.washington.edu/hcde511/)
class. The tutorials use a combination of lecture **instruction**, live coding **demonstration**,
and "do-it-yourself" **exploration**.

We ran the first version of this workshop in Spring 2014
using a combination of Powerpoint slides and JS Bin (for coding along with the slides).
In Autumn 2014, we revised and reformatted the material into this website.

In this new format, you can follow the tutorial on the left side of the screen
while the code is editable in JS Bin on the right side.
This makes the workshop content more accessible and user-friendly,
and, we hope, more useful.

The site was developed with [Harp](http://harpjs.com/)
and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).
The source code is [on GitHub](http://github.com/hds-lab/d3tutorial).
